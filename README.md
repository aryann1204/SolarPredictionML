This project, as part of my machine learning class. explores how to predict short-term solar energy output using machine learning. The core idea is simple: solar power changes a lot with the weather, so accurate forecasting helps energy systems plan ahead and stay stable.

The dataset combines hourly solar output from a public University of Illinois energy repository with local weather records collected through NOAA’s reporting system. The weather features include temperature, dew point, humidity, cloud coverage, visibility, wind speed, and pressure. These measurements were cleaned, averaged across nearby stations for stability, and matched to daytime hours when solar production is meaningful.

Several modeling approaches were tested to learn how these features relate to solar output. Linear regression was used in both its basic form and with dimensionality reduction, and a boosted regression tree model was explored to capture more complex interactions. A recurrent neural network with an LSTM layer was also trained to take advantage of short-term patterns in the data.

The LSTM model achieved the strongest performance, producing lower prediction error and handling rapid weather changes more effectively than the other methods. This result highlights how time-aware deep learning can significantly improve short-term solar forecasting accuracy. I hope this project will be useful for developing smarter grid-management tools, improving renewable energy planning on campuses and small communities, and guiding future models that rely on real-time environmental data for operational decisions.
